coinmarketcap-addon
===================

coinmarketcap.com currency filter - filter displayed currencies.

Too many displayed currencies on coinmarketcap.com giving you headache? Only wan't to follow some on them? This simple extension should help.

It activates automatically after coinmarketcap.com is loaded and remembers your prefered currencies.

Currently, only supported browser is firefox, but I'm planning to port it to chrome.
